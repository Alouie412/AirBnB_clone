              <li><p>Another day passes, yet my heart remains cold. No warm bed nor freshly prepared mabo tofu will ever warm my heart. Aidios, why hath thou forsaken me? Where does my red string of fate lead to? ...Oh, the place was very comforting. The owner is rather scary, though. I only wanted to talk to Shanshan...</li>
              <li><h3>From Armand the 2nd October 1204</h3></li>
              <li><p>This establishment is very comfortable! The food was delicious, the owner and waitress is very kind, and the beds are comfortable! I was also able to finally meet my long lost father thanks to the help of very kind people! 5 stars!</li>
              <li><h3>From Imperial Soldier the 20th, May 1206</h3></li>
              <li>This place is terrible. The owner threatens me with his knife. I can't talk to Shanshan at all. Worse yet, Shanshan slapped me! What's wrong with trying to chat a cute girl up? The food is passing, at least. Definitely will not recommend!</li>
              <li><h3>From Imperial Soldier the 21st, May 1206</h3></li>
              <li>I apologize to the owner and waitress Shanshan for my friend's actions yesterday. He was given strict disciplinary action for his behavior. Please pay no heed to his unfair review.</li>

              <li><h3>From Erebonian Noble the 2th April, 1204</h3></li>
              <li><p>This place is perfect for nobility such as us. I am glad to have made a reservation to see Arc en Ciel's newest play Golden Sun, Silver Moon! Though not listed, they are also in close proximity to a casino. I only wish that they would filter out the commoners and the dogs of Calvard, for they are the only reason I cannot give 5 stars to this otherwise fabulous establishment.</li>
              <li><h3>From Calvard Tourist the 3th August, 1204</h3></li>
              <li><p>A very nice, if rather expensive, lodging. Very close to the newly unveiled Orchis Tower. Btw, the above reviewer is a snob, as expected of someone from the Empire.</li>
              <li><h3>From Liberl Family the 22th October, 1204</h3></li>
              <li><p>We're not blaming the hotel for this, but we were unlucky to have been caught up in a terrorist attack on Crossbell by the Red Constellation. The hotel is really accommodating, but I can't exactly say the same about Crossbell itself, especially after Erebonia and Calvard's response to their declaration of independance.</li>
